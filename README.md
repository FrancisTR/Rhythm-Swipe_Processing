# Welcome to the Rhythm Swipe (Processing) Repository

## Description
A version of the 2D game "Rhythm Swipe" written in Java using Processing.<br>
This project was displayed at the Creative Coding Exhibition at the University of St. Thomas, MN<be>

## Further Details
To demonstrate how to apply creative expression to programming, the program was connected to a homemade controller that resembles a security safe.
The game controller contains a rotary encoder that rotates the character when the encoder is turned, simulating someone trying to unlock a safe. There is also a light sensor, which requires a strong light to face toward it. Once a player blocks the light from hitting the sensor, the character will move forward. The unique controls and mechanics of this game were made in hopes of inspiring future programmers to create similar projects.
The goal of the game is to escape with all the gems while moving only to the beat of the song.<br><br>
